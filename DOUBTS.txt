1.Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

2.Since the emergency-fix branch came directly from master, and no other changes had been made to master while we were working, Git sees this as a continuation of master. So it can "Fast-forward", just pointing both master and emergency-fix to the same commit.As master and emergency-fix are essentially the same now, we can delete emergency-fix, as it is no longer needed.

3.When the pull request has been reviewed and everything looks good, it is time for the final testing. GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging with the master branch.

If any issues arise, you can undo the changes by deploying the master branch into production again!

4.Git will not track files and folders specified in .gitignore. However, the .gitignore file itself IS tracked by Git.
